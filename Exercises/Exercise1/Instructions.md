Exercise 1
==========

Consider the following scenario, determine a set of classes and interfaces (along with their relationships) to implement an object-oriented design for an application to serve the client's needs, and create a UML diagram to illustrate that design.


## Scenario

A university needs to track the courses taken by its students and taught by its faculty.

Each semester a different set of courses is offered. Each course is taught by one faculty member. Students can enroll for any number of courses each semester.

Some courses will appear on the students' transcripts. These will be graded with a letter grade and will cost the student quite a bit to attend.

Other courses will not appear on the students' transcripts. These will be graded as pass/fail and will not cost the student to attend, so long as they are attending at least two graded courses.


## Additional Resources

Any questions to clarify the details of the scenario should be directed to the instructor.
