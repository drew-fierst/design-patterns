Exercise 3
==========

Consider the following scenario and determine what structural pattern(s) would be appropriate to implement. Create a UML diagram to illustrate the pattern(s) you decide upon.


## Scenario

A safety inspection company performs annual inspections of fire alarms and fire suppression equipment in large public buildings.

When they inspect a site, there may be many buildings, each with many floors. Each floor would have a unique collection of equipment that would include:

* Control Panel(s)
* Pull Switches
* Smoke Detectors
* Sprinklers

Each type of equipment has different pieces of data that need to be gathered on an inspection.

When preparing for an inspection, their assesment team would have already determined how many of each type of equipment exist on each floor of each building. They want to print up data sheets with spaces to fill in all of the necessary measurements as the inspectors go through each floor.
