Exercise 2
==========

Consider the following scenario and determine what object creation pattern(s) would be appropriate to implement. Create a UML diagram to illustrate the pattern(s) you decide upon.


## Scenario

An insurance company serves the trucking industry. Their clients have multiple insurance policies of different types (Injury Liability, Property Damage, etc.)

Each policy includes many trucks and many drivers (sometimes hundreds of each). All truck and driver objects have the same initial configuration before any particular identifying information is added to them.

The application will need to efficiently create new insurance policy objects along with their drivers and trucks in order to facilitate the on-boarding process for a new client and the gathering of details about each truck and driver.


## Additional Resources

Any questions to clarify the details of the scenario should be directed to the instructor.
