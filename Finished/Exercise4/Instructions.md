Exercise 4
==========

Consider the following scenario and determine what object creation pattern(s) would be appropriate to implement. Create a UML diagram to illustrate the pattern(s) you decide upon.


## Scenario

A facility services company has long-term contracts with many business clients. They provide janitorial, maintenance and even security services. Each service a client desires adds to the contract price.

They have several different methods they use to calculate the amount to charge a particular client, based on whether that client pays annually or monthly and also whether they pay at the end of each month for services already rendered or whether they pay at the beginning of the month for services they are about to use.
